The recipe book application was developed to support Sanele in his culinary journey after being inspired by the delicious food at Lindiwe's birthday party. With a desire to learn how to cook fantastic dishes like those prepared by Lindiwe's parents, Sanele sought to create a portfolio of evidence by developing a recipe app. This app serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring various recipes, learning cooking techniques, and discovering new culinary skills.
